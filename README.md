# creddit

Creddit is a platform designed to find borrowers find lenders, and lenders find trusted borrowers. What I have implemented, is basically front-end part. I don't have much knowledge about backend, but to show some demo, I have used "localstorage", and "sessionstorage".

The idea is that, lenders and borrowers, can get registered on the website. It is an assumed case, that we will get the credit score of the borrowers, using some API. 

When the borrower logs into the creddit, He can see the lenders, in "myPage" section, and can contact them personally. It hasn't been implemented yet, but the borrower will be able to apply for a certain amout of loan from the lender he finds okay.

The lenders can see the borrowers, in myPage section. The idea is to show only the borrowers who apply for the loan to that particular lender. The lender would be able to see details of appliers, like credit score, and history of the borrower. He would be able to approve loan. All the lenders would be having a fixed interest rate.

After approval, the credit score will be handled based on how early the borrowers returns money.
